<h2>✍️ Reflection</h2>
<p>What went well:</p>
<ul>Adding movement, and creating grid based movement</ul>
<ul>Adding the colour matching system, and making the snake change colours, and grow/shrink based on the vitamin you eat</ul>
<br>
<p>Challenges:</p>
<ul>Pressing 2 keys very fast caused the snake to do the 180 degree and force a collision anda a game over screen,that was troublesome to change</ul>
<ul>Vitamins were spawning in walls, and also balancing the snake speed increase was difficult as Snake increase at the start was very unnoticeable and then all of a sudden it became to fast</ul>
<br>
<h2>Lessons learned:</h2>
<ul>Tim management, next time will try to organize a bit better, spend more time drawing to have higher quality artwork, and pick my topic a bit more carefully because this was challenging.</ul>
